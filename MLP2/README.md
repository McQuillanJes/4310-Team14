# Water Quality

Description: Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.

AttributeNames:
- pH value (float): The indicator of acidic or alkaline condition of water status
- Hardness (float): The length of time water is in contact with hardness producing material helps determine how much hardness there is in raw water.
- Solids (float): These minerals produced un-wanted taste and diluted color in appearance of water.
- Chloramines (float): Chloramines are most commonly formed when ammonia is added to chlorine to treat drinking water.
- Sulfate (float): They are present in ambient air, groundwater, plants, and food.
- Conductivity (float): Increase in ions concentration enhances the electrical conductivity of water.
- Organic_carbon (float): Total Organic Carbon (TOC) in source waters comes from decaying natural organic matter (NOM) as well as synthetic sources. 
  TOC is a measure of the total amount of carbon in organic compounds in pure water.
- Trihalomethanes (float): THMs are chemicals which may be found in water treated with chlorine.
- Turbidity (float): The turbidity of water depends on the quantity of solid matter present in the suspended state. 
  It is a measure of light emitting properties of water and the test is used to indicate the quality of waste
  discharge with respect to colloidal matter. 
- Potability (float): Indicates if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means Not potable.
